The challenges that Golden Shoe are facing:

1. steady decline in revenue
2. Located next to main competitor - which seems to be much busier than golden shoe
3. e-Commerce platform was built around 9 years ago, when most online interactions was done using a desktop.
4. Conversion rates have declined rapidly, and the dropout rates in mobile and ipad devices have increased dramatically.
5. Global Shoe have no mobile app 
6. Quarterly releases

7. Only way to get help is to phone the customer service helpline between 9am-5pm Monday-Friday.

Top 3 reasons for contacting Customer Services:

Returns process
Items showing as in stock, but actually being out of stock
Queries around delivery dates and times

Incorrect shoe size
Didn't like shoe style
didn't like colour

Twitter and Facebook accounts are both unmonitored

The marketing department sends direct mail and catalouges, mail includes £10 voucers, which can only be used in store.

Didn't like shoe style - create a search with shoe type categories
Didn't like colour - create a search with colour as options

Post to Twitter and Facebook accounts, monitor for customer interactions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
